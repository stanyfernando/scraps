A tormented scream turns to be a ghost we carry within ourselves.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# a flight of fancy

A story so blind in my mind far behind
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# a melody that haunts my reverie

Will spring ever come if I shed a teardrop from my eye while my heart
stands still?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
## afore you leave

I'll be a story in your mind Don't forget As time passes by. As final
goodbye this'll be Promise you'll make it a good one for me.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# against a cold grey breeze

As wildflowers sway Deep in the meadow reading a memo I enjoy a sunset
away
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# ailing of a lonely space whale

An ocean of dead stars In a rampant reservoir with abundant scars
Filling memoir
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# art thee th're?

A ghost hiding in my grief said to me she's my echo
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# as death falls apart

Shadows fall As the angels above run out of breath
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# bare a world that none suffers

Fading sand Dreaming grand Despairs at hand Remains a withered land.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# before the dark does

Follow my tears with the wind where it may turn into mist
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# bugger this for a lark!

Glimmers of lights in distance that may have been stars once. Fermenting
in dissent and discord; Withering away in a stale of infinite variety.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# but what ending will you make for yourself?

A wave of ring creeps upon my soul As I sing over a love lost like it
was long ago yearning to let go like a dying dove.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# clanging chimes of doom

Fathom against the whispers of the night I am weary as the time behind
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# damped in distress

Fall of the guillotine blade Saunters vaguely downwards Like summer
withering crops In a satanic frost.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# dreams and droplets

Beach toward stubborn stars Stare at the stale skies Therein lies a
fable of what could've been.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# drowning my stress in quiet

My scars tell a good tale of unfaithful deed and darkness.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# echoes of hope for the creature of despair

Faces you can't forget Flickering from dream to dream Wondering what
lays beyond death As a vast shadow stands erect behind me.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# edge of the abyss is where god works

A withered waif First one to fray Tired and frail Struggling to prevail
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# evenings don't console me anymore

Lost souls that never really lived As history passes by Into a
bottomless vanity
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# godspeed my lonely angel

When I miss you stars seem to fade Leaving nothing but an ill sky.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# had i been there

I'll be there haunting you Wherever your sin begins
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# i alone can never be

Close your heart Until I reawaken the light.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# i lost my breath is all

Ever are we just bound or are we blind? Against a tethered soul deemed
kind.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# i remember who i am now

Alone out on an open road keeping my distance as my fate befold
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# i share my dreams with ghosts

Changing seasons Uncharted lands Had my heart Over your hand.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# i stand as i fall

Beneath a sky that is grey I write my loneliness away As my heart falls
into decay
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# I travel in a world you can't even imagine

Sorrows we never wept Sufferings we kept As darkness crept We overslept
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# i will never get used to walking on solid light

Somewhere deep inside Something lies cold as ice Far beyond sorrowed
skies I always lived too many lies.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# ill humour in the morning brings about a darkened day

Enlighten an eye that won't explore that no one dare to abhor.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# into every life a rain must fall

Clouds above the bay Floats as she sang
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# it hurts to grow

I watched my fate blow away My grief go away. Without remorse or reward
I cannot escape this narrow hallway.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# it was ever thus

As prayers were wasted Dreams were plagued When the night is nigh Bare a
pain that suffice
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# it's not gravity that's holding me down

I follow the rain as I drift across- -a salty plain Skulking in a-
-never-ending nightmare to forget my own name.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# I'll carry our secrets to the grave if I have to

Will the ghost of my dreams ever forgive me?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# just a passing comfort

An enormous burden by rigidity Or is this just stupidity? A moment of
lucidity Hailing for some credibility
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# message from the raven

What ails you stranger? Have you come to warn me of danger? Why stop
being a ranger? Was it the bloody manger?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# mornings are for heartbreaks

Why do people leave, When they leave? Where does the sky go, When it
rains? Where do I go, Now that you're no more?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# my choice of lover.

Way toward a vacant sky I hear a cry passing by Beyond a deepening sigh
Raining out your wandering eye.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# nose deep in devil's dandruff

What do you think We will see In this stream of leaking dreams?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# old as the sunlight

When the currents are stronger It revealed a wound that never healed I
delect a pain I once let go Forewarned about the darkness Against a
cleansing fire That lit up my entire valley erstwhile.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# one last swan song

A tree by the sea That could foresee Unable to unfree Stands upon its
debris.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# one that starts your name

As you whisper into my heart Heavens fall all over my soul
 
===============================================================================================================================================

=============================================================================================================================================== 
**\# sacrifice is a choice you make**\#

I'm loosing dreams In an ever ending stream Among the haunted screams
Reaching toward a thwarted gleam.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# scorched earth

Where do they go? The cars we never drive Where do they go? The planes
we never land Where do they go? The sorrows we never wept
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# scrap canon

Where the may afternoons land An eternity in hand Trot through sand
Tacking strand Withstand
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# some moths feed on tears of sleeping birds.

Once far ashore Couldn't abhor A good man strike afore. Said no more.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# songs of desperation

Gentler sky seem to abide when you walk by my side. When you smiled
Sunset seem wide
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Standing in burning sand

Despair that grew cruel, Can you hear me cry? Hear my prayer At this
dark hour
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# summon the shadows of an ancient past

In a sunless space where darkness reigns therein lies a wonder filled
with grace.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# sweeping cold wind across the lake

Flowers bloom When you walk Under sunlight

Stars fall When you stare From far above.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# the dead don't need light

As doom befalls a darkness waves by my window.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# the doom we foresaw

In the gloom before dawn, A path lies ahead, Withered by vile dark mist,
Leading to a fate we dread.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# the lovers, the dreamers and me.

I'll listen in vain As the flower fades I'll stay in shadows As the fire
goes out.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# tides across the concrete ocean

Come back to city of lights Pack up your starry kite To see across
thousand sights. What a night to reunite
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# time seem to fade into one empty hole

As dawn breaks in my mind still remains to be an empty shell.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# today's no day to fall apart

My being burns while I cry Stars tumble before my demise A final breath,
a final gaze As my death draws near- my soul soars through space- into
the eternal light.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# trial of a traitor

Shadows in dust Rolling with gust Harder to trust Told me in disgust
what I lust.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# untitled 01

Nothing feels empty, Then everything is. Nothing feels alone, Then
everything is. Nothing feels sad, Then everything is. Nothing feels the
same, Then everything is.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# untitled 02

Beyond space and time You'll always be mine
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# untitled 03

I'm so alone I don't want to feel this no more I want to be loved
forever more Take this away from me I'm no more.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Untitled 04

People always leave When you need them the most So I stopped expecting
from people So they wouldn't leave me.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# untitled 05

I don't know where I've been Don't know where to begin Holding myself
like a loose hinge Just a matter of time with the wind
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# untitled 06

Echos of despair Skulking in my nightmare
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# untitled 07

As stars fade toward a stale dark sky, Our love remains infinite.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# untitled 08

Ages pass slowly Skies feel lonely
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Well wishes for a well witch

Deep in the abyss Listening to my soul I see crystal beams Across an
untenanted gloom
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# what kills hope?

Why do we condone? What we bonded over grief Why do we confine? What we
bonded over sorrows
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# what name do you bare? pt.&nbsp;01

On a cold night afore In a far away ashore A stranger by a tree Told me
of a local lore.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# what name do you bear? pt.&nbsp;02

Once the tale was told Hours past I woke up sore Leaves in the wind as
they soar I find no stranger who told me of a door.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# what name do you bear? pt.&nbsp;03

Ages pass as the storm roar I walk toward a door at a shore I knock as
it felt familiar to my core It opened to reveal the tree from before
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# whatever festers my heart like a mold

I've never been bold Time made me old My soul is cold or so I was told
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when does a sin becomes a sin?

Behind the door there is a hell you built and left me in
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when heaven starts to cry

As my love becomes a sacrifice angels wave goodbye.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when hours seems to disappear

I wait every day as night flies as sunlight spies through my shaded
windows - as once again the light gets - repelled by darkness.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when meadows fall

Cold grace of the wind Feels warm and tender When you whisper in my
mind.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when the timer ends

Scars above sunlight Visible under moonlit skies
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# whereupon god smites ye dead

Depth of your faith Desecrating our grave.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# will mercy be enough?

Overlooked and undermined I got left out and left behind
