# a flight of fancy

A story so blind in my mind far behind

Will spring ever come if I shed a teardrop from my eye while my heart
stands still?

As wildflowers sway Deep in the meadow reading a memo I enjoy a sunset

Filling memoir

A wave of ring creeps upon my soul As I sing over a love lost like it
was long ago yearning to let go like a dying dove.

into decay

===============================================================================================================================================

In the gloom before dawn, A path lies ahead, Withered by vile dark mist,
Leading to a fate we dread.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# the lovers, the dreamers and me.

I'll listen in vain As the flower fades I'll stay in shadows As the fire
goes out.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# tides across the concrete ocean

Come back to city of lights Pack up your starry kite To see across
thousand sights. What a night to reunite
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# time seem to fade into one empty hole

As dawn breaks in my mind still remains to be an empty shell.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# today's no day to fall apart

My being burns while I cry Stars tumble before my demise A final breath,
a final gaze As my death draws near- my soul soars through space- into
the eternal light.

# what name do you bare? pt.&nbsp;01

On a cold night afore In a far away ashore A stranger by a tree Told me
of a local lore.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# what name do you bear? pt.&nbsp;02

Once the tale was told Hours past I woke up sore Leaves in the wind as
they soar I find no stranger who told me of a door.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# what name do you bear? pt.&nbsp;03

Ages pass as the storm roar I walk toward a door at a shore I knock as
it felt familiar to my core It opened to reveal the tree from before
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# whatever festers my heart like a mold

I've never been bold Time made me old My soul is cold or so I was told
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when does a sin becomes a sin?

Behind the door there is a hell you built and left me in
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when heaven starts to cry

As my love becomes a sacrifice angels wave goodbye.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when hours seems to disappear

I wait every day as night flies as sunlight spies through my shaded
windows - as once again the light gets - repelled by darkness.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when meadows fall

Cold grace of the wind Feels warm and tender When you whisper in my
mind.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# when the timer ends

Scars above sunlight Visible under moonlit skies
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# whereupon god smites ye dead

Depth of your faith Desecrating our grave.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# will mercy be enough?

Overlooked and undermined I got left out and left behind
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# excerpt from the unknown pt. 01

The haunting presence of my past lingers,
Like a shroud of death that clings and fingers,
Each memory a spectre that chills my bones,
An unyielding darkness that I cannot disown.

=============================================================================================================================================== 
# excerpt from the unknown pt. 02

Their secrets, so eerie, haunted my soul,
As they whispered of horrors, beyond control,
And though I longed for the comfort of sleep,
My mind was trapped in a nightmare, too deep.

=============================================================================================================================================== 
# symphonies from the crypt.

Within depths of my haunted mind
Where cobwebs binds all secrets behind
In this darkest hour a flicker of light
Amidst the shadows, there’s strength to find.

=============================================================================================================================================== 
# voice of her forgotten echoes

From the void, where stars dance and die
The sound of her voice, once a sweet serenade.
Through lands of despair, he wanders the night,
Drowning in the depths, erasing a haunting voice.

=============================================================================================================================================== 
# mistake not the stars with their reflection in the pond.

As a new era dawns,
An evil fate befell me,
Beyond the fate of my demise,
A pain pierces my soul—
Like a fire burning inside a tree—
And a darkness that never will cede.

=============================================================================================================================================== 
# pas de deux veillée nocturne

Under a sky ablaze with stars
Crimson roses dance with the wind-carried by the night breeze;
As the petals wept for moonlight
A fading flame longed for their dancing shadows.

===============================================================================================================================================
# celestial canopy and the cosmic cadence

Each beat of my heart,
Your whispers etched in stardust's art, 
Our souls entwined, orbiting free,
Your kiss on my lips, serene harmony.
===============================================================================================================================================
# through a haunted graveyard of our love

Amidst the crumbling stones, I roam,
Etched with scars, lost and alone,
Reduced to whispers, barely a name,
Tales of love lost, haunted by my dame.
Her essence in echoes, intertwined, 
In thy eternal flame, our souls combined.
===============================================================================================================================================
# unburied sins of the past

Wandering through worlds,
Which lie undiscovered.
Feeling the flames,
Awaiting death as my fare.	
===============================================================================================================================================
# the wish i whispered when it all began, did it forge a love you might never have found?

Row me under starlit skies,
With a kiss planted sweet as a dream.
My eyes gleam like mountain stream.
I profess my love with hues of grace,
That thaws my heart with your heated embrace.
===============================================================================================================================================
# the muses don’t speak to me no more pt. 01

Once that is dead born a new 
my cold larder beckons so few
Weaving fate by my window
For later I woke all alone
===============================================================================================================================================
# the muses don’t speak to me no more pt. 02

When it's cold enough to see the melody
A flower blooms once more and as the oceans boil away
That scent that moment I dread as they fade
I sense an echo of slaughter
Until my feathers soaked in blood.
